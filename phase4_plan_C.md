# Phase 3: Vendor Plan D - The Family Office Compounder (Parallel Structure)

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a parallel three-entity structure that mirrors a classic private investment fund, designed for maximum efficiency and scalability for a single family.

1.  **`Founder's MgmtCo, Inc.` (The "GP"):** A C-Corporation that will act as the General Partner/Manager for two "sister" entities. It will employ the Founder.
2.  **`HAL2025 R&D, LLC` (The Tech Co):** A "sister" LLC, owned by the family trusts, that will conduct R&D. It will have a simple Management Services Agreement with the GP.
3.  **`Founder's Investment Fund, LLC` (The "Fund" / "LP"):** A "sister" LLC, owned by the family trust, that will act as the investment fund. Its Operating Agreement will grant a performance allocation to the GP.

The goal is to isolate the initial R&D venture from the investment fund, creating a clean structure for future growth.
