Venture Inception Plan: The R&D Partnership (Preferred Equity Model)
1. Confidential Memo: Founder's Intent & Business Plan
This document outlines the strategic plan for a new R&D venture. The following section provides the business context and founder's intent to inform all legal and accounting work.
A. Founder & Vision
The Founder is an accomplished Portfolio Manager with a deep technology background. The central thesis is that "alpha" in modern asset management is no longer derived from traditional analysis but from the creation of proprietary, AI-driven technology platforms (the "IP").
The venture's purpose is to create a technology "factory," not just a single product. The initial $600,000 budget is for R&D to build the core platform. The long-term vision (Phase 3) is for this entity to act as an "Incubator," using its core IP to spin out new, distinct trading strategies and software platforms.
B. The Business Model (Justification for PHC Avoidance)
This entity must be structured as an active technology company, not a passive investment fund. This is the central pillar of the entire plan.
Primary Business: The company's business is the creation, development, and monetization of software and intellectual property.
Monetization: Its revenue will be "service revenue," derived from:
Software Licensing: Licensing its IP to clients.
Managed Services: Providing investment management services using its proprietary IP (e.g., in a "2 and 20" capacity).
First Client: The Founder (personally) will be the company's first, arm's-length, paying customer via a formal "Investment Management Agreement" (IMA).
This "active service" model is the legal basis for avoiding Personal Holding Company (PHC) status when the entity "flips" to a C-Corp, enabling the goal of tax-efficient internal compounding.
C. Justification for the Partnership Structure
The choice of a multi-class "R&D Partnership" (Preferred/Common) is deliberate and necessary to achieve three non-negotiable goals that a simple C-Corp cannot.
To Align Risk & Tax Loss (Deductibility): The $600,000 in R&D will generate an operating loss. The Founder is the only partner contributing this capital. The "Preferred Equity" and "Special Allocation" structure is the standard, economically-sound method to allocate 100% of the tax loss to the only partner who is economically at risk for that capital.
To Gift Future Growth (Gifting): The "Preferred/Common" structure allows the Founder to gift the "Common Units" (future growth) to trusts at a defensible, "near-zero" Day 1 valuation.
To Achieve the "C-Corp Flip" (Compounding): This structure allows the entity to operate in its "loss" phase as a partnership (for the tax write-off) and "flip" to an active C-Corp for its "profit" phase (for compounding), having already completed the gifting.
2. Executive Overview: The 5 Objectives
This plan achieves your five core objectives in a legally sound and defensible manner.
The $600k Tax Write-off: To personally capture the full $600,000 in startup costs as an ordinary tax loss.
The Employee Benefits: To create a structure that provides you with "earned income" (via Guaranteed Payments) to max out a 401(k).
The "Near-Zero" Gift: To gift the venture's future growth to your kids' trusts at a nominal Day 1 valuation.
The C-Corp Compounding: To "flip" the entity to a C-Corp that can "internally compound" profits without being a "Personal Holding Company" (PHC).
100% Control: To maintain full operational control as the General Partner.
3. The Strategic Plan: The "R&D Partnership"
The correct structure is a single LLC taxed as a Partnership, which will "check the box" to become a C-Corp in Phase 2.
Entity: One (1) LLC is formed: "Pasadena AI Research, LLC" (or similar).
Purpose: This is an active technology company whose business is R&D, software development, and providing investment management services.
Ownership: This is a multi-class partnership.
You (General Partner): You have 100% voting control. You own "Preferred Units."
Kids' Trusts (Limited Partners): They have no control. They own "Common Units."
4. The Core Mechanisms (How It Works)
This plan replaces all "risky" maneuvers with standard, IRS-approved legal structures.
1. The "Preferred Equity" Model (Funding & Gifting)
The Gift (Day 1): Your lawyers form the LLC with you and the Kids' Trusts as the initial partners. The trusts are gifted their "Common Units" on this day, before any money is in the company.
The Funding (Day 2+): You make Phased Capital Calls (e.g., $200k at a time) to fund the $600k budget. This is your "Preferred Equity" contribution.
The "Liquidation Preference": Your "Preferred Units" entitle you to the first $600,000 in profits from any sale or dissolution. This makes the plan economically sound. The kids' "Common Units" only get value after your $600k preference is paid back.
2. The "Special Allocation" (The Tax Write-off)
The Partnership Agreement will have a "Special Allocation" clause.
It legally states that since you are the only partner risking capital (via your Preferred Units), 100% of the first $600,000 in operating losses are allocated directly to you, personally.
This is your $600k ordinary tax loss, and it is defensible because it aligns the tax loss with your real economic risk.
3. The "First Client" Contract (The Earned Income)
The Partnership's "R&D" is for a paying customer.
You, personally, will be that first customer.
Your lawyers will draft a formal "Investment Management Agreement" (IMA) between the Partnership and you.
You will pay the Partnership a documented, fair-market fee (e.g., "2 and 20").
This proves the Partnership is an active service business, which is what allows it to (A) pay you "Guaranteed Payments" (earned income for your 401k) and (B) avoid PHC status when it flips to a C-Corp.
5. The 2-Phase Timeline (The Payoff)
Phase 1: The R&D / Loss Phase (Year 1)
The Partnership operates, spending the $600k and developing IP.
The $600k loss is "specially allocated" to you.
You receive your "Guaranteed Payments" (earned income).
Phase 2: The C-Corp "Flip" (Year 2+)
The Partnership files Form 8832 to "check the box" and be taxed as a C-Corp.
Your "Preferred Units" and the trusts' "Common Units" become C-Corp stock.
The C-Corp's business is active service income (from the IMA). It is NOT a Personal Holding Company.
Goal Met: It can now retain and "internally compound" profits.
Phase 3: The "Incubator" (Long-Term Vision)
This new C-Corp acts as the parent company to fund and "spin out" new ventures.
6. Entity Formation & Cost Analysis (The $600k Budget)

Personnel - Interns ($200,000): Covers 10 interns ($150,000) plus a $50,000 buffer.

8. Dissolution & Wind-Down Scenarios
Scenario A: "Hard Dissolution" (Failure in Phase 1)
Event: The $600k is spent, the R&D fails.
Action: The Partnership liquidates assets to pay final creditors.
The Loss: The $600k operating loss has already been "specially allocated" to you.
The "Preference": The Partnership has no money to pay your $600k "Liquidation Preference." This is your real loss, which justifies the tax deduction.
The Kids: The "Common Units" are worthless.
Scenario B: "Soft Dissolution" (IP has some value)
Event: The IP is sold for $1,000,000.
Action: The Partnership sells its assets and dissolves.
The Payout:
You (Preference): You get the first $600,000 back.
All Partners (Common): The remaining $400,000 is split between you and your kids' trusts based on your "Common Unit" ownership.
Result: This proves the structure works and has economic substance.

this was a plan that I drafted. I want to keep working on it, however the workflow isn't right.

need a pipeline, lets work all words, no code. 
phase 1) resources, constraint, desires, also listing out some "tricks"
phase 2) discourse about this. Probably just one document
phase 3) of the viable alternative, we present the best formed version of this plan. This will be 2 docs per plan- just the "implentation" where we say what it is. then theres the "for vendor" doc where we present a fully formed plan to present to our accountants, lawyers and me. 
        required things includes    
            project timeline
            requirements for each actor, with Timeline
            rationale and execution plan. 
            upfront and running budgets
            enough so that every agent can understand the project with no additional context and "get to work"

phase 4) we survey those presentations, and discuss which one to pick. probably a single document. 

so based on this document, I am going to want you to me iterate through the 3 phases. 

as we have discourse, all phases of the documents will be altered, don't change them without discussing whats going to change. for now, take crack at making phase 1-3 based on what you see here. stay in the directory. feel free to use Median
