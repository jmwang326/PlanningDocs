# L1T: Nomenclature

**Purpose:** A definitive glossary of all standard terminology. Consistency is mandatory.

## Core Data Structures

-   **`GlobalAgent`**: A queryable representation of a single entity (person, vehicle) across all cameras and time. It is **not a stored object** but is computed from an aggregation of `LocalTrack`s.
-   **`LocalTrack`**: The fundamental unit of observation. A continuous track of a single agent from a single camera within one 12-second chunk.
-   **`Detection`**: A single bounding box from a single frame, generated by a YOLO inference. A `LocalTrack` is composed of multiple `Detection`s.

---

## Processing Components

-   **`ChunkProcessor`**: Converts a 12s video chunk into a list of `LocalTrack`s.
-   **`TemporalLinker`**: Links `LocalTrack`s from the same camera across chunk boundaries.
-   **`IdentityResolver`**: Assigns a `global_agent_id` to `LocalTrack`s, effectively merging tracks across different cameras.
-   **`EvidenceProcessor`**: Resolves ambiguous `identity_candidates` for a `LocalTrack` when new evidence becomes available.

## Key Concepts & Attributes

-   **`Portal`**: A spatial zone where an agent can transition between observed and unobserved states. Explains tracks starting or ending mid-frame.
    -   **`Permanent Portal`**: Static, e.g., a doorway.
    -   **`Temporary Portal`**: Transient, e.g., a parked vehicle.
-   **`6x6 Inter-Camera Grid`**: A matrix storing the minimum observed travel time between cells of any two cameras. Used to determine the plausibility of a merge.
-   **`Camera State`**: The operational mode of a camera.
    -   **`Standby`**: Idle state, minimal processing.
    -   **`Armed`**: Motion detected, awaiting agent confirmation.
    -   **`Active`**: Confirmed agent is being tracked.
    -   **`Post`**: Cool-down period after an agent is lost.
-   **Identity Resolution States**:
    -   **`Auto-Merge`**: High-confidence merge performed automatically.
    -   **`Queue for Review`**: Plausible but uncertain merge candidate requiring adjudication.
    -   **`Reject`**: Definitive decision that two tracks are not the same agent.
-   **Frame Profiles**:
    -   **`sub profile`**: Low-resolution stream used for detection.
    -   **`main profile`**: High-resolution stream used for identification (face/LPR).

## External Services

-   **`CodeProject.AI`**: The external service used for specialized AI models.
    -   **`face_recognition`**: Identifies known individuals.
    -   **`LPR`**: License Plate Recognition.

## System & Configuration

-   **`MarengoCam` / `Marengo`**: The name of this system.
-   **`Blue Iris`**: External software that provides camera streams.
-   **`Stage`**: An operational configuration preset (e.g., `DEV_SLOW`, `PROD_AUTO`).
-   **`Phase`**: A major architectural development milestone (e.g., `Phase 0`, `Phase 1`).
