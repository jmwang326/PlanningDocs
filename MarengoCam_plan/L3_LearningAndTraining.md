# Level 3 - Learning and Training

## Purpose
This document defines the tactical plan for the **Learning and Training Subsystem**. It describes the offline processes for spatial learning and face library building.

## Offline Learning Mode
This document primarily describes the tactical plan for the **Offline Learning** mode. This mode consists of a suite of tools and scripts designed to process historical data in bulk to bootstrap the system's intelligence before it goes live.

### Accelerated Learning Projects
This section is a placeholder for detailing specialized, offline projects designed to accelerate the system's learning process. This may include tools for:
*   Bulk-processing and labeling historical video to build the initial face library.
*   Analyzing historical merges to discover the initial set of camera overlaps.
*   Synthesizing training scenarios for edge cases.
