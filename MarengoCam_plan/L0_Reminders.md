# MarengoCam Planning Reminders

## Purpose
This file captures topics that need attention to prevent orphaning important issues. These are reminders, not a task list or journal.

---

## Active Reminders

### Database NEEDS SPEC Items
**Merged tracks storage:** Junction table vs array column (see L13_Database.md)

**Review queue storage:** Separate table vs query-based (see L13_Database.md)

---

### Hardcoded "10 cameras" Assumption
**Location:** L1_Mission.md references "10 cameras" - should be configuration parameter

---

### L3 GUI and Configuration Expansion
**L3_Gui.md:** Minimal - needs timeline viewer, review queue UI, playback specs

**L3_Configuration.md:** Has YAML structure, needs hot-reload mechanics and validation

---

### L4 Concept Files Planned
**Potential extractions:** GridLearning, AlibiCheck, PortalTransitions, VehicleOccupancy, Timeline, FaceLibrary

---

## Notes
- Reminders only - not a journal or status log
- Add when issues discovered, remove when resolved
- Keep concise
