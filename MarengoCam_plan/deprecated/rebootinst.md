We need to redo the framework for planning out Marengo Cam. 
..
I want one file which basically leaves instructions for the agent common name it appropriately. Lets call this Level 0
..
I want another file which is very high level which mentions our motivations and philosophies. Lets call this Level 1

 
I want another file which in a non technical way describes what and why will be occurring. Level 2

Another nontechnical file which describes the how, when level 3

correspondence technical phasing levels will be level 11 and 12. 

we may refine this, but this should be a part of your level 0 docs. 

this is a work in progress, but I want to take whats in this directory and refine it along this hierarchy. you will discourse and push approved edits to our phasing files. the goal is to have each level be consistent. 
for each level file, there should be a corresponding D file-for discourse. we will, very briefly explain rationale for certain decisions, and possible tradeoffs. this is our record of the discourse, but we want it to be very brief. 

at each level, if the topic is too big, we might break it into a smaller file. for example Ph3_Ingestor (which probably gets a Ph3D_Ingestor) because the topic has become kinda big. 

I am trying to make this more of a consistent process to make it easier to review the project. If you have suggestions for how to accomplish the goal along these sorts of lines, we can discourse. If we agree, the goal will be to take the existing data files, move them to deprecated, and repopulate against the new framework in this directory. let me know if that makes sense. we will review level 1, push changes to all, to see what conflicts, and iterate, till this is a project that can be rolled out. The final version of instructions ends up in level 0 document. essentially the OS. 

so OS is level 0, 1 is mission definition 2 is strategy 3 is tactics, and then 11, 12, 13 is corresponding technical specs.
