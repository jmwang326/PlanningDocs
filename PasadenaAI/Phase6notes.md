# Phase 6: Notes on the Anderson LP/IDGT Plan

## Project Overview

This document memorializes the strategy proposed by legal counsel (John Anderson) for discussion and clarification. This plan supersedes the previous three-entity LLC structure with a more complex model designed to address specific concerns around minority shareholder rights and estate planning.

The core of the plan is a six-entity structure:

1.  **Three Limited Partnerships (LPs):** These will be the primary operating and investment vehicles. The LP structure was chosen specifically to mitigate potential "minority rights" issues with the children's involvement. The LPs can be converted to C-Corporations later if the ventures are successful.
    *   `Pasadena Mgmt, LP` (The GP/Manager)
    *   `Pasadena R&D, LP` (The Tech OpCo)
    *   `Pasadena Fund, LP` (The Investment Fund)

2.  **Three GP LLCs:** Each LP will be managed by a corresponding General Partner, structured as a Wyoming LLC for cost and administrative efficiency.
    *   `Pasadena Mgmt GP, LLC`
    *   `Pasadena R&D GP, LLC`
    *   `Pasadena Fund GP, LLC`

3.  **Trust Structure:** A single, professionally managed Nevada (NV) Grantor Trust will be established for the benefit of the children. The Founder will not be a beneficiary.

4.  **Funding Mechanism:**
    *   **Trust Funding:** The NV Trust will be funded via an Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT) sale. The Founder will sell income-producing assets to the trust in exchange for a promissory note, which may be structured as a Self-Cancelling Installment Note (SCIN). The Founder remains responsible for the trust's annual income taxes.
    *   **OpCo Funding:** The Founder will make annual cash gifts to the NV Trust. The trust will then use this cash to make its capital contributions to the operating LPs.

## Key Questions & Areas for Clarification

This section highlights critical points that require further explanation to ensure a complete understanding of the plan's risks and mechanics.

1.  **Allocation of Losses Above Basis:**
    *   **Observation:** The plan suggests that operational losses from the LPs can be allocated back to the Founder. However, the proposed funding model has the Founder contributing only a fraction of the capital directly (e.g., $60k of $300k), with the majority coming from the children's trust (funded by the Founder's gifts).
    *   **Question:** How are partnership losses allocated to the Founder in excess of their direct capital contribution and economic basis in the LPs? Is the mechanism that the losses flow to the NV Grantor Trust (as the primary capital partner) and are then reported on the Founder's personal tax return due to the trust's grantor status? This distinction is critical for assessing the tax risk of the structure.

2.  **Nature of the Promissory Note (SCIN):**
    *   **Observation:** The note from the IDGT sale was described as "cancelling on death."
    *   **Question:** Does this imply the use of a Self-Cancelling Installment Note (SCIN)? If so, what is the "risk premium" (e.g., higher interest rate or principal) being applied to ensure the transaction is respected by the IRS and not re-characterized as a partial gift?

3.  **LP vs. LLC Minority Rights:**
    *   **Question:** Could you elaborate on the specific "minority rights" issues in an LLC context that are solved by using an LP structure? Understanding this will help clarify the trade-off for the increased complexity of the six-entity model.
