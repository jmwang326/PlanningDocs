# Phase 3: Vendor Plan B - The Hybrid Model (2-Entity)

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a two-entity "HoldCo/OpCo" structure to separate investment activities from business operations. Both entities will be California LLCs taxed as partnerships initially.

1.  **`Founder's HoldCo, LLC` (HoldCo):** This entity will be 100% owned by the Founder's Trust. It will act as the investment vehicle, holding capital and owning the OpCo.
2.  **`HAL2025 R&D, LLC` (OpCo):** This entity will be the operating business. It will have a two-class equity structure:
    *   **Common Units (Growth):** Owned 40% by Children's Trust 1, 40% by Children's Trust 2, and 20% by the HoldCo. This ownership will be established via an initial co-investment.
    *   **Preferred Units (Capital):** Owned 100% by the HoldCo, acquired in exchange for the main R&D capital contribution.

The goal is to isolate liability, create a clean operational entity, shift 80% of the future growth to the next generation, and position the OpCo to convert to a C-Corporation for long-term compounding.
